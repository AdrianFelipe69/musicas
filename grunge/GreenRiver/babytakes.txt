The more I die, the more you live
Baby takes so much to give
The more you heal, the more I ache
Baby gives so much to take
The more you touch, the less I feel
Baby has so much to steal
The more you feel, the less I am
Well, baby stole so much to have
Give until it hurts
Give until it hurts
Give until it hurts
Give until it hurts
Down inside and dry as a bone
Baby's upstairs all alone
Outside and wet like a fish
Baby took too much to give
Baby never asked to live
Baby never asked to live
Baby never asked to live
Baby never asked to live
No
Live until it hurts
Live until it hurts
Live until it hurts
Live until it hurts
It hurts
Live
