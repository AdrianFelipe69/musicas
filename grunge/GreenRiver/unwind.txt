Come on over to my place
I'll show ya some time
Come on over to my place, baby
I wanna watch you unwind
Come on over to my place
So I can, so I can, so I can
So I can yeah, I can I can
(I can)
Fuck your mind
Open mind, barely alive
An open mind is an empty mind
Sew my seed, feed your thoughts
I'll get ya thinkin' anything I want
Sew my seed, feed your thoughts
I'll get ya thinkin' anything I want, anything
Anything I want,
Open mind, empty inside
You've got nothing, nothing to hide
Got your whole world in the palm of my hand
This is all that you understand
Got your whole world in the palm of my hand
This is all that you understand
This is all
All you can stand, baby
(Poor feeble little mind)
Your blown mind ain't a pretty sight
Your poor mind makes me feel alive
An empty shell to play inside
That's right baby, open wide!
Unwind, unwind, unwind
Unwind, unwind, unwind
Sow my seed, feed your thoughts
I'll get ya thinking anything I want
Sow my seed, feed your thoughts
I'll get ya thinking anything I want, anything
Anything I want, yeah
Anything I want
Anything I want
Anything I want
Anything, anything, anything, anything I want
Anything, anything, anything, anything I want
(I want)
