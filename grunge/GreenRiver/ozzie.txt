Look at that girl, she's in the corner
She's the one with the hair down to her toes
She's the weird one, the really weird one
She's a girl that nobody knows
I watch her, ecstatic
My fingers break down to each other
Just a thought and I'm fogged in the rest
Then my brain goes down, down, down, down and out
I got the picture of a thief
I never got this lucky
She comes to me wearin' nothing
I don't even know, you just have to do that to her
I've got the secret of the river
That's right baby, the green river
You better watch out, get you too
No one's ever made me go down, down, down
Out of my head, out of my head
Oh, I watch her, I'm ecstatic
Her fingers break down to each other
And made my mind like silly puddy
My brain is going down, down, down, down and out
Making me go down
Making me go down
Making me go down
She's a girl, she's in the corner
She's the girl with the long hair to her toes
She's a girl and she's a weird one
She's a girl that nobody knows
I know the secret of the river
That's right baby, the green river
I fed her the secret of the river
Now I'm gonna make 'em reel me on
